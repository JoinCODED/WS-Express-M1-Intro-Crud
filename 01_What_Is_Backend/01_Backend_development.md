So far, what we have learned in the previous phase is how to create a static website, its content doesnâ€™t really change much.

For static sites, all the necessary information that determines whatâ€™s on the web page is in the frontend code itself. Static websites are good for things like landing pages or portfolios. But if you want to turn your site into something that users can interact with, youâ€™ll need to communicate with a backend, but what is a backend? ðŸ¤”

There are generally two parts any web application the `front-end` or a `client-side` and the `backend` or a `server-side`.
The `front-end` consists of the web pages you see and interact with in your browser, but how are those pages delivered to the browser? and when a user enters data into those pages where does it go? ðŸ¤”

When a user enters a URL, clicks a link or submits a form, their browser connects to a `web server`, a `web server` is just a computer running software that delivers resources like web pages and images or other forms of data.

When a `web server` receives a request for a resource it needs to respond with that resource.
Programming `web servers` to respond with the correct resources is the domain of back-end development.

So `front-end` is about designing web pages and `back-end` is about serving up those web pages.
As a `front-end` developer you need to focus on the look and feel of a website and the user experience,
but as a `back-end` developer you will focus on the data of the website in various forms where users can enter data to create profiles, share stories, keep track of appointments and so on.
